# Proof of Concept for Math Learning Platform
I started designing this as part of my Master's program.

I wanted to demonstrate the usage of HTML animations to reduce cognitive load, the ability to have an interactive glossary on the side of the page in case students want to review terminology as they go along, and a few other items.

This is a __very__ rough sketch of what such a platform might look like, and I'm in the (very slow) process of re-coding it using better UI/UX principles. It's not designed responsively right now, either. Still, I hope the overall aesthetic and minimalist approach offers a vision of what we can develop!

At present, it's live at: <br/>
