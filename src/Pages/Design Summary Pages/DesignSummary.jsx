            <p>This website was created for LSE-542, a class centered on digital learning.</p>
            <p>Leveraging content from the course, as well as some preexisting design knowledge I possessed, I attempted to apply some best practices in this website creation.</p>
            <p>I also tried to apply other principles from other classes I've taken in this program.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, since I'm not an experienced web developer, I'm not sure how to implement all of the intended features.</p>
